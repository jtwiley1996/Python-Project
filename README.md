# Python Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using Python. The steps include setting up the environment, preparing the data, exploring and cleaning the data, analyzing the data, building models (if applicable), and evaluating the results. Make sure to have python and pip installed before attemption the installation below.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.3
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jtwiley1996/Python-Project.git
   cd Python-Project
    ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install the required packages**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
4. Prepare Data

Place your CSV file in the project directory. Ensure it is named data.csv or update the script accordingly.

### Running the Analysis

1. Place your CSV file

Make sure the `data.csv` file is located in the same directory as data_analysis.py.

2. Run the script
    ```bash
    python3 data_analysis.py
    ```

3. Output

The script will display the contents of the CSV file, a statistical summary of the data, and data types.

### Script Details

data_analysis.py: Reads data.csv, prints the data, shows statistical summaries, and displays data types.

    ```bash
    import pandas as pd

    # Load data
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Display data
    print("Data:")
    print(data)

    # Display statistical summary
    print("\nStatistical Summary:")
    print(data.describe())

    # Display data types
    print("\nData Types:")
    print(data.dtypes)
    ```
